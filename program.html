            The URL below is for the JQuery library version 3.6.4 hosted on the jQuery Content Delivery Network (CDN). 
            It's a common practice to use a CDN to include popular libraries like jQuery as it allows for faster loading times
            and reduces the load on your own server. By using this script, the jQuery library is made available for use in this
            HTML document. jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies many common tasks, such
            as DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX requests, making it easier to write JavaScript code. -->
